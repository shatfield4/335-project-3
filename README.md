# Soccer Path Algorithms Comparison

This project contains two algorithms for finding the number of possible paths in a soccer field grid, avoiding obstacles and opponents. The algorithms are implemented in Python and are compared using empirical analysis.

## Files

- `dynamic_programming.py`: Contains the `soccer_dyn_prog` function, which implements a dynamic programming algorithm to find the number of possible paths in the grid.
- `exhaustive_search.py`: Contains the `soccer_opponent_avoidance` function, which implements an exhaustive search algorithm to find the number of possible paths in the grid.
- `timing_comparisons.py`: A script that compares the two algorithms by running them on random test inputs of varying sizes and recording the execution times.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Run the `timing_comparisons.py` script by executing the following command:
``python timing_comparisons.py``

This will run both algorithms on random test inputs of varying sizes (defined in the `input_sizes` list) and print the execution times for each algorithm.

## Output

The output will show the timing data for both algorithms as lists of execution times. Each value corresponds to the execution time for a specific input size, in the same order as the `input_sizes` list.
